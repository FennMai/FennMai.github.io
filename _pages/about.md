Hello! My name is Fenn Mai, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my website. 

I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Glasgow. 

I am very interested in robotics and autonomous driving planning and control.

I currently mainly study and code slam on the Linux system.
