Hello! My name is Fenn Mai, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my website. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Glasgow. My academic journey is driven by a profound interest in the intersection of technology and practical applications, especially in the field of robotics.

In addition to my studies, I have a diverse range of hobbies that include coding, playing traditional Chinese instruments, and basketball. These activities not only enrich my skills but also provide a wonderful balance to my academic pursuits.

Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you find the content insightful and engaging!
